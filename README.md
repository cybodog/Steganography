# AES-DCT Steganography

## 📌 Problem Statement
Traditional encryption methods secure data but make it obvious that encryption is being used. This project implements AES encryption with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)-based steganography to hide encrypted data within an image, making it undetectable while ensuring security.

## 🛠️ Technology Used
- **Python** (Core programming language)
- **AES Encryption** (For secure data encryption)
- **DCT Steganography** (For hiding encrypted data in images)
- **OpenCV** (For image processing)
- **NumPy** (For mathematical operations)
- **Matplotlib** (For visualization)

## ✨ Wow Factor
- Combines **encryption (AES)** and **steganography (DCT)** for double-layer security.
- Hidden data remains visually undetectable.
- Secure transmission of sensitive information via images.
- Efficient implementation using optimized mathematical techniques.

## 🎯 End Users
- **Cybersecurity Enthusiasts**: To learn and implement secure communication techniques.
- **Journalists & Activists**: For securely transmitting confidential data.
- **Military & Intelligence Agencies**: For covert communication.
- **Data Privacy Advocates**: Ensuring secure personal data exchange.

## 🚀 Result
- AES encryption secures the message.
- DCT transforms the image into frequency components to embed encrypted data.
- The modified image contains the encrypted data while appearing unchanged.
- The hidden data is extracted and decrypted successfully.

## 🔚 Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the combination of encryption and steganography for secure and undetectable data transmission. It enhances cybersecurity applications by ensuring confidentiality and integrity while keeping the data visually hidden.

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Implementing **Deep Learning** for enhanced steganalysis resistance.
- Extending to **video steganography** for larger data embedding.
- Optimizing the algorithm for **real-time communication systems**.
- Implementing a **GUI-based tool** for user-friendly operation.
